## 💡 The Best of Both Worlds: Brand Story

**We can USE the connection!**

### **Brand Narrative:**
> "AETER comes from the Latin 'aeternus' meaning eternal. Often confused with the Greek 'aether' (the cosmic element), AETER represents both: the **eternal permanence** of time and the **infinite space** of the cosmos. Your files live in eternal space."

### **Tagline Options:**
1. "Eternal space" ← Combines both concepts
2. "Where files become eternal"
3. "Permanent as the cosmos"

### **Visual Identity:**
- Use cosmic/space themes (nod to aether)
- But messaging focuses on permanence (aeter)
- Logo: A∞ or ÆTR with stars
