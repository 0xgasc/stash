# AETER - Integrated Business Strategy
## Combining Market Research + PermaStore Business Case

**Brand:** AETER (from Latin "aeternus" = eternal)
**Domain:** aeter.space
**Tagline:** "Eternal space for your files"

---

## 🎯 Core Insights from PermaStore Document

### **What They Got RIGHT:**

1. ✅ **Freemium Model with Testnet**
   - Free 6-month storage on testnet (ZERO cost)
   - 5-10% conversion to paid
   - This is GENIUS - we adopt this

2. ✅ **Irys Cost Structure**
   - Irys Mainnet: $0.80-1.50/GB
   - Our cost: ~50-66% margin
   - **BUT:** They say $2.50/GB pricing (we can undercut at $2/GB)

3. ✅ **Perceived Value Pricing (Zora Model)**
   - Charge premium for features that cost same to deliver
   - File size limits = psychological anchoring
   - "Priority uploads" = $0 cost, perceived value
   - **THIS IS THE KEY**

4. ✅ **Unit Economics**
   - CAC: $3-5 (Web3 organic)
   - LTV: $80-120
   - LTV:CAC = 16:1 to 40:1 🔥
   - Payback: 1-2 months
   - **INSANE METRICS**

5. ✅ **Customer Personas**
   - NFT Creator (primary)
   - Journalist (secondary)
   - Web3 Startup (tertiary)
   - **We validated these in our research!**

## 🚀 AETER's IMPROVED Strategy

### **What We Do BETTER:**

#### **1. Pricing: Undercut PermaStore**

**PermaStore Pricing:**
| Tier | Price | Storage | Their Cost | Margin |
|------|-------|---------|------------|--------|
| Free | $0 | 200MB testnet | $0 | N/A |
| Starter | $3/mo | 5GB | ~$5 | 40% loss! |
| Pro | $10/mo | 25GB | ~$25 | 60% margin |
| Creator | $25/mo | 100GB | ~$100 | 75% margin |

**AETER Pricing (Better):**
| Tier | Price | Storage | Our Cost | Margin |
|------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Free** | **$0** | **500MB testnet** | **$0** | N/A |
| **Starter** | **$5/mo or $50/yr** | **10GB permanent** | **$10** | **80% after month 2** |
| **Pro** | **$15/mo or $150/yr** | **50GB permanent** | **$50** | **70% after month 4** |
| **Creator** | **$30/mo or $300/yr** | **200GB permanent** | **$200** | **67% after month 7** |

**Why ours is better:**
- ✅ **Bigger free tier:** 500MB vs 200MB
- ✅ **Better value:** 10GB for $5 vs 5GB for $3
- ✅ **Annual discount:** Encourages upfront payment
- ✅ **Higher absolute margins:** More storage = more value perception

---

#### **2. Branding: Consumer-Friendly vs Tech-First**

**PermaStore:**
- ❌ Generic name ("PermaSto re" = meh)
- ❌ Tech-focused messaging
- ❌ Web3-only positioning

**AETER:**
- ✅ **Abstract, global name** (Latin roots)
- ✅ **Cosmic theme** (aeter.space = eternal space)
- ✅ **Consumer + Web3** (not just crypto nerds)
- ✅ **Emotional messaging:** "Where files become eternal"

---

#### **3. Multi-Brand Strategy**

**PermaStore:**
- Single brand, single audience (Web3)

**AETER Platform:**
```
AETER (parent)
├── AETER (consumer/NFT - one brand for both!)
└── AETER ENTERPRISE (white-label B2B)
```

**Revenue streams:**
1. Consumer subscriptions
2. NFT/Web3 API
3. Enterprise white-label
4. B2B compliance (legal, medical)

## 🧠 The Genius of Perceived Value Pricing

### **From PermaStore Doc - The "Zora Model"**

**Key Insight:**
> "Storing a 3GB video costs us the same per GB as storing a 3MB image, but we charge 8x more for 'video tier' access."

**How we apply this:**

1. **File Size Limits = Psychological Anchoring**
   - Starter: 100MB/file = "for documents and photos"
   - Pro: 500MB/file = "professional tier"
   - Creator: 3GB/file = "premium for video creators"
   - **Reality:** All cost us $1/GB regardless!

2. **"Priority" Features (Zero Cost)**
   - Pro gets "priority uploads" = same infrastructure
   - Creator gets "NFT API" = just CORS-enabled endpoint
   - Custom domain = costs us $0, perceived value $10/mo
   - Analytics = simple query, huge perceived value

3. **Bundling Strategy**
   - Each tier gets previous tier features PLUS:
   - Pro = Starter + custom domain + priority
   - Creator = Pro + video + API + analytics
   - **Upsell ladder**

### **Example Revenue Math:**

**Video Creator uploads 100GB:**
- **Charged:** $30/mo + $0 overage (200GB allowance)
- **Our Cost:** $100 one-time (100GB @ $1/GB)
- **Month 1:** -$70 (loss)
- **Month 2:** +$30 (profit)
- **Month 3:** +$30 (profit)
- **Month 4+:** Pure profit ($30/mo forever)
- **After 4 months:** $10 profit, then $30/mo = **300% CAGR**

## 👥 Customer Personas (Validated)

### **Primary: NFT Creator (Alex)**

**Profile:**
- 28, digital artist
- Mints 10-50 NFTs/month
- Pain: IPFS isn't permanent

**User Story:**
> "I need to guarantee my NFT metadata exists forever. IPFS isn't actually permanent unless someone pins it. AETER's free tier let me test, then I upgraded to Pro. Now I tell collectors their assets are truly eternal."

**Conversion Trigger:** 5-month warning email + collection gaining value
**Chosen Tier:** Pro ($15/mo) - needs 50GB for collections + metadata
**LTV:** $180/year

---

### **Secondary: Independent Journalist (Maria)**

**Profile:**
- 35, investigative journalist
- Covers censored topics
- Pain: Sources get deleted, governments suppress info

**User Story:**
> "I report on sensitive topics where sources get scrubbed. I need permanent, immutable backups. The free tier let me test with non-sensitive material. When I needed to preserve leaked documents, I immediately upgraded. The permanent links I cite in articles are invaluable."

**Conversion Trigger:** Critical story needs permanent evidence
**Chosen Tier:** Starter ($5/mo) + top-ups as needed
**LTV:** $60-100/year

---

### **Tertiary: Web3 Startup (DevDAO)**

**Profile:**
- DAO building decentralized app
- 5-person dev team
- Pain: Can't use AWS (defeats purpose), Arweave too expensive

**User Story:**
> "We're building a decentralized social network and can't use traditional cloud storage. We tried Arweave directly but costs were prohibitive. AETER's API tier gave us Irys pricing plus programmatic access. We integrate it into our deployment pipeline now."

**Conversion Trigger:** Need for API access + volume
**Chosen Tier:** Enterprise (custom) - 500GB+/month
**LTV:** $1,000-5,000/year
