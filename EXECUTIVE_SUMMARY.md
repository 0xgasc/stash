# Storer - Executive Summary

## 🎯 The Opportunity

**Problem:** People pay $120/year FOREVER for cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox). Over 10 years, that's $1,200 for 100GB.

**Solution:** Storer charges $99 ONCE for permanent storage on Arweave blockchain. Same 100GB, lasts 200+ years.

**Market Size:**
- 2B cloud storage users globally
- $100B+ cloud storage market
- Growing 20%+ annually

**Our Wedge:** Start with NFT creators (50K users) who NEED permanent storage, expand to creators (5M), then B2B compliance (500K businesses).

## 💡 Why This Works

### The Psychological Insight
People don't buy storage—they buy **PEACE OF MIND**.

**What customers fear:**
- Hard drive crashes
- Cloud providers deleting their account
- Paying forever for something that should be one-time
- Losing irreplaceable memories

**What we sell:**
- Digital insurance
- One-time payment, lifetime protection
- Mathematically impossible to delete (blockchain)
- 200-year guarantee

### The Pricing Insight
We're not competing on PRICE—we're competing on TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP.

**Google Drive:** $120/year × 10 years = $1,200
**Storer:** $99 once = **92% savings**

Even if we charged $500, it's STILL cheaper than 5 years of Google Drive.

### The Market Timing Insight
1. **NFTs proved:** People will pay for permanent storage (broken IPFS links are a real problem)
2. **Creator economy boom:** 50M+ creators need reliable storage
3. **Compliance regulations:** GDPR/HIPAA require long-term data retention
4. **Crypto adoption:** People understand blockchain value now
