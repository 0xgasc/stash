# Storer - Business Model & Financial Analysis

## 💰 Cost Structure (Real Data - Jan 2025)

### Storage Costs

**Irys (our provider):**
- Standard: $0.05/GB = **$0.00005/MB**
- Enterprise: $0.03/GB = **$0.00003/MB**
- Free: <100KB uploads

**Arweave (direct):**
- Base cost: ~$9-12/GB (via providers like Akord)
- Raw network: ~$6-8/GB
- 200+ year permanent storage

**Our advantage:** Using Irys is 16x cheaper than going direct to Arweave, and we get the same permanence!

## 📊 Pricing Model (What We Charge)

| Tier | Storage | Duration | Price | Cost (Irys) | Margin | Target |
|------|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Free** | 100MB | 1 month | $0 | $0.005 | -$0.005 | Acquisition |
| **Starter** | 5GB | 6 months | $10 | $0.25 | **$9.75** (3,900%) | Creators |
| **Pro** | 50GB | 1 year | $50 | $2.50 | **$47.50** (1,900%) | Businesses |
| **Premium** | Unlimited | Permanent | $200/year | ~$10/50GB avg | **$190** (1,900%) | Enterprise |
| **PAYG** | Custom | Permanent | $0.01/MB | $0.00005/MB | **$0.00995/MB** (19,900%) | Variable |

**Key insight:** Our margins are INSANE (1,900-19,900%) because we're selling convenience + permanence, not just storage.

## 🎯 Revised Pricing Strategy

### The Problem with Current Pricing
- **Too cheap relative to value:** $0.01/MB = $10/GB vs Google Drive's effective $1,200 over 10 years
- **Customers don't understand permanence:** They think cloud storage = permanent storage
- **Race to the bottom:** Competing on price alone

### The Solution: Value-Based Pricing

**New Positioning:**
> "Storer isn't storage—it's **permanent digital insurance** for your irreplaceable files."

### Revised Pricing Tiers

| Tier | What You Get | Annual Cost | vs Google Drive (10yr) | Value Prop |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Free Trial** | 500MB, 1 month | $0 | - | Try it out |
| **Personal** | 50GB permanent | $99/year | Save $1,020 | Family photos, videos |
| **Creator** | 200GB permanent | $299/year | Save $1,860 | RAW footage, masters |
| **Business** | 1TB permanent | $999/year | Save $10,800 | Legal docs, backups |
| **Enterprise** | Custom TB+ | Custom | ROI analysis | Compliance, archives |

**Why this works:**
1. **$99/year** sounds reasonable for "never lose your data again"
2. Still **91% cheaper** than Google Drive over 10 years
3. Margins drop to ~500% but volume increases 10x
4. Perceived value matches actual value delivered

## 💡 Alternative Model: "Digital Vault" Subscription

Instead of selling storage, sell **peace of mind:**

### The Vault Model

**Monthly Plans:**
- **Vault Starter**: $9/mo → 10GB/year permanent storage allowance
- **Vault Pro**: $29/mo → 50GB/year permanent storage allowance
- **Vault Business**: $99/mo → 250GB/year permanent storage allowance

**How it works:**
1. Customer pays monthly subscription
2. Each month, they get X GB "storage credits"
3. Upload anytime during subscription
4. Files remain **permanent forever**, even if subscription ends
5. Unlike Google Drive, **you own your storage allocation**

**Example:**
- User pays $9/mo for 12 months = $108
- They get 10GB permanent storage (cost us $0.50)
- Margin: **$107.50** (21,500%)
- Even if they churn after 1 year, files stay permanent
- We keep the margin, they keep their data

**Why customers love this:**
- Familiar subscription model (like Netflix)
- "Set it and forget it" backup
- Even if they cancel, files are safe
- Psychological: paying $9/mo feels better than $99 upfront
