# Storer - Go-To-Market Strategy

## 🎯 Core Positioning

**Tagline:** *"Your files. Forever. For real."*

**Elevator Pitch (30 sec):**
> "Storer is permanent digital insurance for your irreplaceable files. Unlike Google Drive, which charges $120/year forever, we charge $99 once and your files are stored on the Arweave blockchain for 200+ years. No monthly fees. No deletion risk. True permanence."

**One-Liner for Ads:**
> "Google Drive costs $1,200 over 10 years. Storer costs $99 once. Same storage. Forever."

---

## 🧠 Customer Psychology

### The Core Insight
People don't buy storage—they buy **PEACE OF MIND**.

**What customers are really afraid of:**
1. Losing irreplaceable memories (family photos, videos)
2. Hard drive crashes destroying their work
3. Cloud providers deleting their account
4. Paying forever for something that should be one-time
5. Not owning their own data

### Emotional Triggers
- **Fear:** "What if I lose everything?"
- **Regret:** "I should have backed this up..."
- **Relief:** "Finally, I can stop worrying"
- **Control:** "I own my data, not Google"
